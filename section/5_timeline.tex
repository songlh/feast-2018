\section{Project Timeline}
\label{sec:timeline}


The proposed research consists of three main phases. Activities are distributed
across different years, which ensures an optimal balance in time management and
student recruiting. Table~\ref{tab:timeline} outlines the project timeline,
which spans three years. 


% We will first conduct a comprehensive study to
% understand how software developers implement a protocol. Second, we will focus
% on exploring, designing and developing technical approaches to automate protocol
% implementation identification, finite state machine extraction and protocol
% dialog recovery. Third, we will expend various program analysis tools to perform
% protocol dialect generation. Finally, we will evaluate all the proposed
% techniques using a large corpus of real-world applications.

We expect to refine our agenda as we continuously validate our research and make
improvements, in particular with inputs from our on-going evaluations that
include lab testing and large scale experiments. We plan to have two project
critical reviews, one at the beginning of the second year and the other at the
beginning of the third year, to examine our progress and revise our plan and
approaches based on feedback from ONR program managers, industry partners as
well as results from our own research activities.
